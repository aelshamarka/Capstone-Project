# Capstone-Project
I'm running my notebook on Anaconda3 (Jupyter), I suggest you use the same environment inorder to have all the necessary libraries. 
The raw data file needs to be in the same directory as the 'Initial_Data_Analysis' notebook to be successfuly read so once you download the data from the gmail attachment please copy it inside your local repository, and then you can rerun the notebook. 
I noticed the table have formatting issues on Github, I suggest viewing them through the native Jupyter in order to see the tables without issues. 
If you need to rerun the classification models notebooks 'logisticreg','MLP_CLF', 'SVM_CLF_Final Comparison' please make sure that the data file 'SBAnational_final'(already uploaded in my repository) is in the same directory.
