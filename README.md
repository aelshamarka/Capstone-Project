# Capstone-Project
I'm running my notebook on Anaconda3 (Jupyter), I suggest you use the same environment inorder to have all the necessary libraries. 
The raw data file needs to be in the same directory as the notebook to be successfuly read so once you download the data from the gmail attachment please copy it inside your local repository, and then you can rerun the notebook. 
I noticed the table have formatting issues on Github, I suggest viewing them through the native Jupyter in order to see the tables without issues.
